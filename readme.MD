# Front-end Assignment

Hello! And Welcome!

This assignment is a way for us to assess that you're able to translate design into code and how you would normally structure your code.

## The assignment

The assignment is - in short - to convert  the [design/master-the-front-end.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rommel-dk/wp-museum-test/master/wp-content/themes/museum/assignment-assets/design/master-the-front-end.pdf) design to HTML/CSS/Blocks using WordPress (we have also provided the design as a [Figma](http://figma.com/) file if you want to get a few more details).

There are no strict "rules" for the execution of the assignment except that it should be responsive and delivered to us as a pull-request. The ultimate goal is to create the design as lean, neat and simple as possible. 

Feel free to still do the assignment even though you do not have the time to complete it but instead create a `readme.md` file or a description in the pull request where you explain what you would have done and why you selected to create the parts you did.

Check the folder: wp-content/themes/museum/assignment-assets/ for all the assets needed for the assignment.

### Requirements

The base requirements are simple: Translate the design into a WordPress front-page using HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/Blocks/WordPress.

* Responsive and Mobile First
* Make a pull request with your results to this repository.

### Wishlist

We would love to see that you're capable of some of the following skills:

* Mobile First methodology
* Building reusable components and blocks
* Keep the code simple with a component based structure
* Animations where you deem it relevant
* Maybe even set up a build process for theme assets
* JavasScript assets could be "non jQuery" and CSS could be done using PostCSS or Sass
* Running git commits (so not just one at the end saying "initial commit")
* No use of 3. party HTML/CSS grid or component frameworks
* _Your own creativity**_

_** Feel free to display your own creativity in the assignment. An example of this would be to fetch the articles in the grid from a JSON object or replacing them with an API service to display the latest articles from another source. We only wish that the "soul" of the project still remains when you're done._

### Skip the line

_*You can skip the line and go straight to an interview if you're able to re-create the design in a WordPress website using React based Gutenberg blocks (or ACF blocks) while maintaining a good structure and pretty code.*_
